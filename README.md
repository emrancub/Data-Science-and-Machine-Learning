# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning

**I will include everything here what I am learning.**

A personal playground for practicing **Python**, doing **data analysis/EDA**, and building **ML/DL** models on different datasets. This repo grows as I learn—step by step, experiment by experiment.

---

## 🧰 Tools I Will Use (Updated as per learning...)

* **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib/plotly, seaborn
* **ML**: scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM
* **DL (optional)**: PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras
* **Config/Tracking (optional)**: YAML + MLflow / Weights & Biases

I’ll keep this flexible and pick libraries depending on the problem.

---

## 📊 Typical Metrics & Checks

* **Regression**: RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE
* **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision/Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC
* **Sanity checks**: leakage, class imbalance, drift hints, baseline vs. fancy models

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap (will update)

* [ ] Add template notebooks (EDA, baseline model)
* [ ] Add `src/dsml/` utilities (data, features, metrics)
* [ ] Add experiment tracking (MLflow or W&B)
* [ ] Add simple deployment demo (FastAPI batch/predict)
* [ ] Write model cards in `reports/`

## 📄 License

I will add a license (e.g., MIT) once I settle on it.

## 🙌 Thanks

Learning in public—thanks to the open-source community behind these tools.
