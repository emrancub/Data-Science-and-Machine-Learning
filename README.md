# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning

**I will include everything here what I am learning.**

A personal playground for practicing **Python**, doing **data analysis/EDA**, and building **ML/DL** models on different datasets. This repo grows as I learnâ€”step by step, experiment by experiment.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools I Will Use (Updated as per learning...)

* **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib/plotly, seaborn
* **ML**: scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM
* **DL (optional)**: PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras
* **Config/Tracking (optional)**: YAML + MLflow / Weights & Biases

Iâ€™ll keep this flexible and pick libraries depending on the problem.

## ðŸ“Š Typical Metrics & Checks

* **Regression**: RMSE, MAE, RÂ², MAPE
* **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision/Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC
* **Sanity checks**: leakage, class imbalance, drift hints, baseline vs. fancy models
